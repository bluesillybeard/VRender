# VRender
Voxelesque's "Not As Bad As It Used To Be" Rendering backend

HOW TO USE:
VRender is pretty simple actually.
Too bad though because I am too lazy to make a guide.


TODO list:
- "proper" text rendering
- text rendering cache
- interpolation system (should be pretty easy)
- use Monitor for multithreading rather than spin-waiting
- implement more types of thread pools, and use an interface for them
- Finish implementing GL33 GPU objects
- - implement a memory leak catcher using C# destructor
