# VRender
## Trilateral's "Not As Bad As It Used To Be" Rendering backend.
it's "VRender" instead of "TRender" because it used to be called "Voxelesque" before I renamed it to "Trilateral."

### HOW TO USE:<br>
VRender is pretty simple actually. Too bad though because I am too lazy to make a guide.


### TODO list (most important to least important):
- more types of draw uniforms:
- - 3D textures
- - make a 2D texture not required
- Finish implementing GL33 GPU objects
- - implement a memory leak catcher using destructor
- Implement instanced rendering. Automatically convert GLSL code to work with instanced rendering. The way draw calls are organized should make it pretty easy.
- There are quite likely inline "//TODO:" comments in the code waiting to be remedied
