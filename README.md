# VRender
Voxelesque's "Not As Bad As It Used To Be" Rendering backend

HOW TO USE:
VRender is pretty simple actually.
Too bad though because I am too lazy to make a guide.
But, my VRenderExamples repository has everything you should need to get started.
It's not on Nuget, because I'm too lazy to figure out how to set that up.


TODO list:
- implement more types of thread pools, and use an interface for them
- Finish implementing GL33 GPU objects
- - implement a memory leak catcher using destructor
- Implement instanced rendering. Automatically convert GLSL code to work with instanced rendering. They way draw calls are organized should make it pretty easy.
